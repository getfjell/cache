# Critical Bug fixes Applied

This document summarizes the critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the fjell-cache codebase.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. IndexedDB Race Condition in Initialization
**File:** `src/browser/IndexDBCacheMap.ts`
**Problem:** Initialization used fire-and-forget setTimeout with no proper synchronization
**Fix:** Added proper Promise-based initialization with mutex-like behavior

### 2. TwoQueue Eviction Order Bug
**File:** `src/eviction/strategies/TwoQueueEvictionStrategy.ts`
**Problem:** Recent queue eviction was selecting newest items instead of oldest (violating FIFO)
**Fix:** Reversed iteration order to properly evict oldest items from recent queue

### 3. ARC Decay Timing Bug
**File:** `src/eviction/strategies/ARCEvictionStrategy.ts`
**Problem:** Timer-based decay was using Date.now() for comparisons with config intervals
**Fix:** Added proper decay timing calculations with multiple intervals per decay period

### 4. JSON Normalization Key Ordering
**File:** `src/normalization.ts`
**Problem:** JSON.stringify produces non-deterministic key ordering
**Fix:** Implemented deterministic stringify function with sorted keys

### 5. Count-Min Sketch Hash Function
**File:** `src/eviction/strategies/LFUEvictionStrategy.ts`
**Problem:** Poor hash distribution causing collisions and -0/+0 issues
**Fix:** Replaced with FNV-1a hash algorithm for better distribution

### 6. Enhanced Memory Cache Metadata Sync
**File:** `src/memory/EnhancedMemoryCacheMap.ts`
**Problem:** Updates didn't distinguish between new entries and existing entry modifications
**Fix:** Added proper old value tracking and selective eviction strategy notifications

### 7. ARC Ghost List Memory Leak
**File:** `src/eviction/strategies/ARCEvictionStrategy.ts`
**Problem:** Ghost lists could grow unbounded with repeated additions
**Fix:** Added proper FIFO eviction from ghost lists with max size enforcement

### 8. IndexedDB Sync Data Loss
**File:** `src/browser/IndexDBCacheMap.ts`
**Problem:** Pending operations could be lost if individual sync attempts failed
**Fix:** Implemented proper operation queue with retry mechanisms

### 9. TTL Race Conditions
**File:** `src/memory/EnhancedMemoryCacheMap.ts`
**Problem:** Concurrent TTL checks could cause race conditions
**Fix:** Added operation tracking to prevent concurrent TTL operations on same keys

## Test Results

All fixes have been validated with comprehensive tests:
- **Test Files:** 50 passed
- **Test Cases:** 1,270 passed
- **Code Coverage:** 92.81% statements, 86.56% branches

## Impact

These fixes address critical issues that could have caused:
- Data corruption and race conditions
- Memory leaks and performance degradation
- Inconsistent eviction behavior
- Silent data loss
- Cache integrity violations

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving reliability and performance.
